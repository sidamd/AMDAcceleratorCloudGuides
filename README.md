## July 13-14th AAC Maintenance Update Notice for AAC Users
***

### The AAC Web Interface has moved to https://aac.amd.com 

### 1. How to Fix `ssh <USERID>@aac1.amd.com` failed with `Host key verification failed` message
The Slurm login node was changed during maintenance, so the host key fingerprint is different. SSH users may see a failure to login with a *WARNING* message such as one shown below. Please update `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` by *removing* the existing entries for `dell-r08-01` and retry `ssh <USERID>@aac1.amd.com`  and accept the new fingerprints:
```
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:u1u0/uh0GLcs19KNHrmZIA6EDLMvJACK5y2fMkVg1fg.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:76:6a:a4:34:56:c0:04:fa:7f:84:e6:85:0b:f1:65:e5.
```
#### Solution: 
1. First remove existing fingerprint of old Slurm login host: `ssh-keygen -R aac1.amd.com`
2. Login to the AAC Plano Slurm cluster: `ssh <USERID>@aac1.amd.com`
3. Enter "yes" to accept new host key fingerprint at the prompt to continue to login. 

### 2. How to Fix `The selected queue is no longer available` error

#### Solution:
The Slurm partition/queue names were changed during the maintenance to remove duplicate queue names and standardize on one set. The new partitition names can be used to allocate single node or a multi-node cluster using the Slurm commands.
